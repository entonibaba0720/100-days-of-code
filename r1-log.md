Today I learned to draw with pure CSS. It was great. I learned a lot of about positioning. (https://www.github.com/entonibaba0720/drawing-in-css-koala)

### R1D2
Animated a CSS drawing with JQuery is a lot of fun. I learn about fadeIn() and fadeOut() and other cool stuffs. I learned before JQuery but not practising yet.

### R1D3

Today I started to built my portfolio page.
Thinking about the layout, colors, fonts. It will be very difficult, but I can make this. 

### R1D4

I met the CSS Variables
It was amazing. All I knew about CSS, ... "You know nothing, John Snow"!
