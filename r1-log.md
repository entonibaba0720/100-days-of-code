Today I learned to draw with pure CSS. It was great. I learned a lot of about positioning. (https://www.github.com/entonibaba0720/drawing-in-css-koala)

### R1D2
Animated a CSS drawing with JQuery is a lot of fun. I learn about fadeIn() and fadeOut() and other cool stuffs. I learned before JQuery but not practising yet.

### R1D3

Today I started to built my portfolio page.
Thinking about the layout, colors, fonts. It will be very difficult, but I can make this. 

### R1D4

I met the CSS Variables
It was amazing. All I knew about CSS, ... "You know nothing, John Snow"!

### R1D5

Still working on my portfolio.
It's very hard. I have to learn much about css positioning. I like the work with CSS variables.

### R1D6

My porftolio is almost ready. 
I won a battle against Bootsrap. My weapon was !important. I used a lot of times. 
Next time I won't use it  :D

### R1D7

Today I started to learning Backend with using NodeJS. 
I enrolled some moths ago an Udemy Course - Web Developer Bootcamp with Colt Steele. It's a very long course, and I now started the backend section. It seems very interesting.
